    <h2>What is Pokédex?</h2>
    <p>The Pokédex is an in-game encyclopedia or database in the Pokémon franchise, which records and provides information about the Pokémon species that a trainer encounters or captures. It serves as a guide to all known Pokémon, providing details such as their types, abilities, stats, evolutions, and more.</p>

        <p>Here's a fun, emoji-based breakdown of what the Pokédex represents:</p>
        
        <p>📖 Pokédex= Pokémon Encyclopedia</p>
        <p>💥 Pokémon= The creatures you're trying to find and catch.</p>
